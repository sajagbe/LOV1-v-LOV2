### Files and Descriptions:

1. RMSD Analysis.zip: Data from the Analysis of RMSD for the 6 proteins studied. We applied MDAnalysis here (see File 2)
2. L1vL2-MDAnalysis.py: Script analysisng RMSD per residue for each trajectory. Requires a trajectory multiframe PDB.
3. Pymol Vizualization.md: Few lines of code to help replicate our RMSD, EPM and ESTM vizualizations.
4. EPMs.zip: Mol2 files describing Electrostatic potential at vdW surface of LF in the 6 domains studied.
5. ESTMs.zip: Electrostatic Spectral Tuning Maps of the S(π-π*) and T(N_n-π*) states.
